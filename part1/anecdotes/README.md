# Full Stack Open - Part 1: Anecdotes

This project is the **Anecdotes** application, developed as part of **Part 1: Introduction to React** in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki. It utilizes **Vite** as the development server and build tool, providing a fast and modern development environment for React.

## 🚀 Project Description

This project focuses on building a simple application that displays anecdotes and allows users to vote for their favorites. It introduces concepts of managing state within a React application, handling events to update state, and finding and displaying the entry with the highest value (the anecdote with the most votes).

## ✅ Features

- Displays a random anecdote.
- Allows users to vote for the currently displayed anecdote.
- Keeps track of the votes for each anecdote.
- Displays the anecdote with the highest number of votes.
- Conditionally renders the "Anecdote with most votes" section only after votes have been cast.
