# Full Stack Open - Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps

This repository contains the exercises and materials for **Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps** in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki. This part serves as a crucial introduction to the basic concepts and technologies that underpin web development before diving into modern JavaScript frameworks like React.

## üöÄ Project Description

Part 0 lays the groundwork for the rest of the Full Stack Open course by introducing the fundamental building blocks of the web. It covers how web applications work at a high level, the roles of different technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the basics of how browsers and servers communicate. The exercises in this part are designed to familiarize learners with these core concepts through reading material and creating simple examples or diagrams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

The exercises in Part 0 primarily involve reading material and creating static files (HTML, CSS) or diagrams. There is typically no complex build process or development server required like in later parts.

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devnischandra/fullstackopen.git
cd fullstackopen/part0/

```
