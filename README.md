# Full Stack Open - Complete Course Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the entire [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki. This comprehensive program covers modern web development from fundamental concepts to advanced topics, building full-stack applications using the JavaScript ecosystem.

## üöÄ Project Description

Full Stack Open is an in-depth online course that provides a strong foundation in modern web development. It guides learners through building single-page applications with **React** for the frontend and implementing REST APIs and GraphQL services with **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through a series of exercises that progressively build upon previously learned concepts, culminating in full-stack applications.

## ‚úÖ Features

This repository encompasses exercises covering a wide range of full-stack web development topics, including:

- **Part 0:** Fundamentals of Web (HTML, CSS, HTTP basics)
- **Part 1:** Introduction to React (components, state, props, event handling)
- **Part 2:** Communicating with the server (fetching data, forms, rendering collections)
- **Part 3:** Programming a server with Node.js and Express (building REST APIs)
- **Part 4:** Testing Express servers and user administration (backend testing, authentication)
- **Part 5:** Testing React apps (frontend testing with Jest and React Testing Library, end-to-end testing with Cypress)

- **Part 7:** React Router, custom hooks, styling, and Webpack
- **Part 8:** GraphQL (implementing and using GraphQL APIs)
- **Part 9:** TypeScript (adding static typing to JavaScript)
- **Part 10:** React Native (mobile application development)
- **Part 11:** CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
- **Part 12:** Containers (Introduction to Docker)
- **Part 13:** Using relational databases (Introduction to SQL and relational databases)

Each part typically contains a set of exercises or a project that reinforces the concepts taught in the corresponding course material.
